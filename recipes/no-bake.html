    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A delicious chocolate and peanut butter cookie with oats.
        It a nice and soft cookie that you don't bake like other
        cookies and just takes minutes to prepare. Great for a summer
        day you don't have to worry about turning on the oven and heating
        up the house.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>Vanilla</li>
        <li>Quick Oats</li>
        <li>Peanut Butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First line two baking sheets with parchment paper
            (or just spread a long sheet of the parchment onto
            the counter), or have 29 cupcake liners set out.
        </li>
        <li>Then in a 2.5 or 3 quart saucepan combine sugar,
            butter, cocoa powder and milk.
        </li>
        <li>Set saucepan over medium heat (I like to use the
            largest burner on the stove) and begin whisking.
            Cook and whisk frequently until it reaches a boil,
            then once it reaches a full boil stop stirring and
            let it boil for 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>Remove the mixture from heat then immediately add in
            vanilla, peanut butter and oatmeal. And stir to blend well.
        </li>
        <li>Drop mixture onto prepared parchment dropping 2 Tbsp at
            a time (a medium cookie scoop works well here or just
            use two large spoons).
        </li>
        <li>Let cookies set then enjoy! If you want to speed up setting
            transfer to refrigerator. Store the cookies at room temp
            in an airtight container.
        </li>
    </ol>
